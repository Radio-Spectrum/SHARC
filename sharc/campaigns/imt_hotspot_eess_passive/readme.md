# IMT Hotspot EESS Passive Campaign

This campaign's objective is to try and replicate Luciano's contribution 21.

You can compare SHARC results against Luciano's results with `plot_results.py`.
It automatically aggregates UL and DL considering TDD and SF (segment factor).

We did not take the time to process the Uplink analysis to try and reach the same results.
