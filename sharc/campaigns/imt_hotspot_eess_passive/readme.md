# IMT Hotspot EESS Passive Campaign

This campaign's objective is to try and replicate Luciano's contribution 21.

As such, the `generate_aggregate_cdf.py` and `plot_comparison.py` were made.

After running both uplink and downlink simulations,
you can generate an aggregate cdf based on the TDD and segment factors with `generate_aggregate_cdf.py`.

You can compare SHARC results against Luciano's results with `plot_comparison.py`.

We did not take the time to process the Uplink analysis to try and reach the same results.
