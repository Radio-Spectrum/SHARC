# Radio-Spectrum [SHARC](https://sharcproject.vercel.app/)

Welcome to [SHARC](https://sharcproject.vercel.app/), a simulator for use in SHARing and Compatibility studies of radiocommunication systems. The development of this software is being lead by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) of Brazil, [ANATEL](https://www.gov.br/anatel/pt-br), and it implements the framework proposed by Recommendation [ITU-R M.2101](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.2101/en) for **"modelling and simulation of IMT networks and systems for use in sharing and compatibility studies"**.

### Purpose of [SHARC](https://sharcproject.vercel.app/)

SHARC helps users simulate and evaluate various radiocommunication systems to understand how they share and coexist in the radio spectrum. Whether you're assessing interference, spectrum allocation, or compatibility across different communication technologies, SHARC provides the tools you need to ensure the optimal use of radio frequencies.

Please refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines and how to setup your environment.
